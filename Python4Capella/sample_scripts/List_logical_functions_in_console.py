# This script loads the Capella model passed as first argument and list its root LogicalFunction.
# To run it:
#  - enable Developer capabilities if not already done (see documentation in the help menu)
#  - you can run this script by launching the contextual menu "Run As / EASE Script..." 
#    on this script. 
#    - By default, the model selected is IFE sample (aird path of the model written below)

#  - you can also run this script according to a configuration (script selected, arguments) 
#    and modify the configuration by launching the contextual menu "Run As / Run configurations..." 
#    on this script. 
#    - create a new "EASE Script" configuration
#    - define the name of the configuration: "list_logical_functions_in_console.py" (for instance)
#    - define the Script Source path: "workspace://Python4Capella/sample_scripts/List_logical_functions_in_console.py"
#    - define the path to the aird file as first argument in "Script arguments" area: "/In-Flight Entertainment System/In-Flight Entertainment System.aird" (for instance)
